# Learning Rust

Just some basic projects to familiarize myself with the language, coming from C++.

# Projects
### Hello world
Obligatory.

### Hangman
Good learning exercise as it uses most basic components of every language (types, variables, control-flow, loops, functions).
This implementation also makes a network request to a random word api to source the target word.

### More coming soon...
